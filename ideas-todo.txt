To-Do list:
- /away, /brb appends |Away to your current nickname. Needs no special support for polling other users for their state.
- /back removes |Away from your nickname. Typing a sentance in a non-empty channel changes your name back too.
- Add a /help command, that lists commands
- Double click a user, and get CTCP information about him
- Respond to CTCP version requests
- Add support for private messages, display them in the channel window
- New design philosophy, using a tabbed layout instead of a windowed layout (Google Chrome style)
- Create a non-portable version of TrayIRC, that uses an installer. Can clone itself to a portable version in a new directory. (Copy exe and write ini file)

Idea list:
- /msg other users: /msg Nick Hey what's up?!
- Chat logging
